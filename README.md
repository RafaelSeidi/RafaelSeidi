## Who I am 🙂
Hi! I’m **@RafaelSeidi**, a brazilian programming student! 
In this profile you will see some works that I made to study/test my abilities as a programmer 👨‍💼. 

For now I only know this **programming languages** (at intermediate level):
- C Sharp (C#);
- HTML;
- CSS;
- PHP;
- MySQL;
- Block-based coding in *[MIT App Inventor 2](https://appinventor.mit.edu/)* and *[Kodular](https://www.kodular.io/)*.

## Goals 🎉
I'm interested in growing as a programmer and looking for my first experience in the IT area as an intern. I also want to learn how to use git and programming languages like Python and Kotlin.
